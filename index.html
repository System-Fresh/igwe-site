    <h2>
        IGWE JUDE ONYENWE EZE : RE-INCARNATING DIMEJE OGOLI  ROYAL DYNASTY
    </h2>

    <h4>
        BY
        Chief Jude C.  Ezema (KSJI)
        and 
        Dr. Louis Ezema, JP
         
    </h4>
    <p>
        Leadership is a virtue bequeathed by destiny.  From the cosmological perspectives,  man lives on the earth by playing out the roles divinely ascribed to his person by God. The journey of Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze (Obanekuoshimiri) into traditional administration of his Ugwu na Agbo Edem community is a fire planted in the gene which bid its time to conflagrate at the appointed time. 

Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze can be seen as 

one of the strange creatures that has risen from the ashes of the heroic dead to accomplish what remained undone due to time.

The coronation of Igwe Jude Eze as the traditional ruler of Ugwu na Agbo community  is a square peg in a square hole, a dramatic twist that reinforces the universal aphorism that " Eze anaghi ako n'obi" (royalty does not elude the royal  fortress).  Igwe's grandfather Eze Ngwoke Eze , once ruled Edem as a whole.  His reign as Eze Edem diplomatically handled the  new religion (Christianity) being introduced into Edem, a community which at that time  had a  total pagan population in the early 19th century. He created an atmosphere of peaceful transition and coexistence. Unlike many Igbo communities that went into conflicts 

including war over the whiteman's religion, Eze Ngwoke Eze went into  negotiations that even resulted in his using his personal palace as a makeshift centre for religious activities in Edem. By this gesture,  he turned out to be a strong Afromodernist king who attracted the largesse of civilization,  education and other shades of development to his people. 
With his grandchild Igwe Jude Eze stepping into the terrain of traditional rulership,  one can reflect and ask;
"what size of the shoe did Late Eze Ngwoke leave? An undersized or oversized footwear?"


    </p>
    <h4>
        REMINISCENCES
    </h4>

    <p>
        Various authors have written about the evolution of Ezeship/Igweship in Igboland and have  unanimously observed that the  Eze/Igwe  is the king, the supreme 

authority in any given society.  The appellation Igwe is a term that figuratively captures the enormous power of The king. It is easy to understand  the enormous power of a king when one relates the distance between the earth and the sky (Igwe). Simply put, the power of the king is enormous.  The concept of Eze is a recognizable trait among the ancient Igbo nations such as Arochukwu, Awka, Nri, Owerre and Northern Nsukka communities which include Edem.
Such words as Igwe and Obi, among  others, are used as titles of respect. Igwe is derived from the Igbo word Igwekala or Eluigwekala “the sky or heaven is higher or taller than land”.
People had and still have ruling bodies of royal and political leaders in which an individual can be recognized by the entire society as primus inter pares ie first 

among equals. This status is usually hereditary among the male lineage, since Igbo culture is patrilineal. However in most communities today, Igwe or Eze title can rotate among clans.


    </p>
    <h4>
        EDEM AS A NATION
    </h4>
    <p>
        Edem as a nation is believed to come from one parentage. From history Edem has existed as one people driven by one culture and one tradition. The community is made up of three components or brothers namely; Akpa, Ozi and Edem Ani, so announced in order of seniority. 
 Edem as a  community of strong and influential people is located in part of Northern Nsukka. The community from creation is made up of hard working man and women. The community is gifted in the art of traditional medicine, rainmaking and farmwork. With the emergence of 

education and enterprise, the citizens of the community have gone into various fields of human endeavours and the younger generation have transfered the skills of their forefathers in the field of herbalism to different fields of scientific medicine and surgery.  In the same vein, hundreds of her teeming population are into the military and paramilitary force where they play leadership roles, in civil service where they are leading technocrats, business enterprise etc. Today,  the people have improved on their leadership responsibilities by engaging in politics at national and international levels. 

    </p>
    <h4>
        TRADITIONAL RULERSHIP IN EDEM 
    </h4>
    <p>
        The idea of Eze and traditional rulership in Edem was introduced in about the 17th century. That was when Agbana Eze was enthroned as Eze Edem. He was from 

Igoro Akpa Edem.  His enthronement was facilitated by his closeness to the palace of Attah of Igalla who was married to his sister. Attah noticed his good manners and groomed him to be the Eze of Edem. Attah of Igalla had strong influence on communities in Nsukka judicial province at that time.

Agbana the first Igwe of Edem is from Igoro Akpa Edem and the last to come from there. His reign was brief  because  he killed  his wife for  insisting  that he, Eze Agbana, should come out from his council meeting  to help her put down a pot of water she fetched from the stream. The Oha Edem gathered and dethroned the king. They later chose Dimanyi Oshogwu from Owerre Agbo to replace him as Eze Edem. 
Eze Dimanyi Oshogwu’s reign was 

shortlived, he broke his own rules as he was caught warming himself near a fireplace, a thing which he probably said no one should do. This Eze Edem from Owerre was also discovered to have made earth mound, where he warmed  himself  during meetings while his colleagues were exposed to harmattan cold. This was discovered during one of their meetings and he was overthrown and the kingship offered to Dimeje Ogoli who had the power of making rain to fall from Amenu Edem. He initially declined but when further pressured, he gave the condition that it will be for him and his children after him. His conditions were obliged.(1)
Dimeje Ogoli performed all the ceremonies required of him. He reigned well and was succeeded by his sons and relations one after the other.
The following is the order of succession of 

children and brothers  of Dimeje Ogoli who occupied the exalted stool of Eze Edem:

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1. Eze Dimeje Ogoli</li>
        <li>2. Eze Agiri Iyoke</li>
        <li>3. Eze Edem Ode</li>
        <li>4. Eze Mbakwu Ayori</li>
        <li>5. Eze Omude Dimeje</li>
        <li>6. Ezekan Ugbobe</li>
        <li>7. Eze Onah Idenyi</li>
        <li>8. Eze Ukwunne</li>
        <li>9. Eze Ugwuanyi Nwaechara</li>
        <li>10. Eze Ogan Ukwunne</li>
        <li>11. Eze Dimanyi Ize Ajima</li>
        <li>12. Eze Nwaugwu Ada Ize</li>
        <li>13. Eze Ayigbo Ugwuanyi</li>
        <li>14. Eze Ngwoke Eze and</li>
        <li>15. Eze Francis Asogwa(2)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Eze John Ngwoke Eze was believed to have lived from  1873 to 1948. The said Eze Ngwoke Eze is the grandfather of Engr 

Jude Onyenwe Eze, the traditional ruler of Ugwu na Agbo Edem, who is being coronted today.

    <h4>
        IGWE ENGR. JUDE ONYENWE EZE AND EXPECTATIONS OF A GRANDSON KING
    </h4>

    <p>
        Dimeje Ogoli and his offsprings ruled Edem in succession as aforestated.
Eze Ngwoke Eze was the second to the last of his lineage that ruled Edem. As Eze Edem,  he brought charm and humanity into the Edem local administration. The wave of Christianity making the rounds in the whole of Igboland had strong influence on the leadership direction of Eze Ngwoke Eze
Apart from making promises of a new better life and salvation, the new religion brought social development including schools, hospitals and skill acquisition programmes. Eze Ngwoke was intrigued  

by these developments. He reportedly trekked on several occasions to Nsukka the base of the Christian missionaries to make a case about how the missionaries could send a teacher to Edem to educate the people and administer the new faith. The Nsukka District Priest Fr. Vincent Davey granted this request by sending  one Patrick OKafor from Umuna to Onuagu Amenu  on 29th September, 1929.
To ensure the survival of this project,  Eze Ngwoke housed, fed and  paid this teacher for six months. From his house, Patrick OKafor was attending to his missionary duties at Catholic Mission Onuagu, an area that soon metamorphosed into the legendry Onuegu  primary school. It is important to note that while waiting for Christian activities to  commence fully at the newly established mission, Igwe Ngwoke Eze allowed Christian activities to 

take place in his house. 
Igwes's house was used as the church till after six months when the Catholic mission at Onuegu started full operation and that was when the first mass was celebrated in the church on 4th October  1930 by Fr. Vincent Davey (3).
As the Eze Edem, Eze Ngwoke combined his traditional administration with Christian formation which ultimately resulted in the establishment of an egalitarian Edem society. The level of socialisation was upped, even as people began to make input into how their affairs will be administered.  Eze Ngwoke was driven by democratic ideals. 
Eze Ngwoke successfully created the Onuagu Mission which served as the worship center of the whole of Edem between 1929 to 1935. There was a growing concern to reduce the strain of 

people from lower Edem Ani ( the Agbo Edem  Ani). That was how the mission was transfered to Nweke Ogbete in Agbo Edem Ani in 1935 and named St. Paul's Catholic Church which to the glory of God is today,  a fully functioning Church with thousands of parishioners. 
The historic Catholic mission at Onuagu retained its spot as a divine centre and served as primary school and worship centre until 1977 when it was inaugurated as St Theresa's Catholic Church Ugwu na Agbo, attaining the status of a parish in 2013.
As Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze ascends the throne as traditional ruler of Ugwu na Agbo Community,  we wish him a peaceful reign and wisdom.
We wish him peaceful collaboration and brotherly love with other Igwes in Edem as they join hand to uphold the indivisible 

unity of Edem as  a  community.

                <!-- <p> THE MAKING OF A KING
                    HRH Igwe Engr Jude Onyenwe Eze was born as the first son and second child to the family of Ozo Prince Christopher Eze (London boy) of Amenu Edem and Mrs Theresa Anyaburu  Eze from Akpa Edem in 1966. Prince Christopher was the second son of the then reigning king of Edem,  Eze Ngwoke Eze.  Young Onyenwe started his primary education at Onuegu Mission,  the present day CPS Ugwu na Agbo Community primary school in September 1974. His siblings are Victoria, Stella, Nwamaka , Okwudili, Lebechi, Nkechi and  Ifeanacho. 
                    Like all great men,  HRH Engr Jude O. Eze had his shaky start when in 1976, he underwent a major surgery due to ruptured appendicitis at Akulue Memorial Hospital Onuiyi, Nsukka. This exercise nearly took  
                    
                    his life due to series of complications. He survived and emerged from the event with strong will and hard boiled skin to navigate the onerous challenges of life.
