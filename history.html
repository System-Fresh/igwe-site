    <h2>
        IGWE JUDE ONYENWE EZE : RE-INCARNATING DIMEJE OGOLI  ROYAL DYNASTY
    </h2>

    <h4>
        BY
        Chief Jude C.  Ezema (KSJI)
        and 
        Dr. Louis Ezema, JP
         
    </h4>
    <p>
        Leadership is a virtue bequeathed by destiny.  From the cosmological perspectives,  man lives on the earth by playing out the roles divinely ascribed to his person by God. The journey of Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze (Obanekuoshimiri) into traditional administration of his Ugwu na Agbo Edem community is a fire planted in the gene which bid its time to conflagrate at the appointed time. 

Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze can be seen as 

one of the strange creatures that has risen from the ashes of the heroic dead to accomplish what remained undone due to time.

The coronation of Igwe Jude Eze as the traditional ruler of Ugwu na Agbo community  is a square peg in a square hole, a dramatic twist that reinforces the universal aphorism that " Eze anaghi ako n'obi" (royalty does not elude the royal  fortress).  Igwe's grandfather Eze Ngwoke Eze , once ruled Edem as a whole.  His reign as Eze Edem diplomatically handled the  new religion (Christianity) being introduced into Edem, a community which at that time  had a  total pagan population in the early 19th century. He created an atmosphere of peaceful transition and coexistence. Unlike many Igbo communities that went into conflicts 

including war over the whiteman's religion, Eze Ngwoke Eze went into  negotiations that even resulted in his using his personal palace as a makeshift centre for religious activities in Edem. By this gesture,  he turned out to be a strong Afromodernist king who attracted the largesse of civilization,  education and other shades of development to his people. 
With his grandchild Igwe Jude Eze stepping into the terrain of traditional rulership,  one can reflect and ask;
"what size of the shoe did Late Eze Ngwoke leave? An undersized or oversized footwear?"

    <h4>
        REMINISCENCES
    </h4>

    <p>
        Various authors have written about the evolution of Ezeship/Igweship in Igboland and have  unanimously observed that the  Eze/Igwe  is the king, the supreme 

authority in any given society.  The appellation Igwe is a term that figuratively captures the enormous power of The king. It is easy to understand  the enormous power of a king when one relates the distance between the earth and the sky (Igwe). Simply put, the power of the king is enormous.  The concept of Eze is a recognizable trait among the ancient Igbo nations such as Arochukwu, Awka, Nri, Owerre and Northern Nsukka communities which include Edem.
Such words as Igwe and Obi, among  others, are used as titles of respect. Igwe is derived from the Igbo word Igwekala or Eluigwekala “the sky or heaven is higher or taller than land”.
People had and still have ruling bodies of royal and political leaders in which an individual can be recognized by the entire society as primus inter pares ie first 

among equals. This status is usually hereditary among the male lineage, since Igbo culture is patrilineal. However in most communities today, Igwe or Eze title can rotate among clans.


    </p>
    <h4>
        EDEM AS A NATION
    </h4>
    <p>
        Edem as a nation is believed to come from one parentage. From history Edem has existed as one people driven by one culture and one tradition. The community is made up of three components or brothers namely; Akpa, Ozi and Edem Ani, so announced in order of seniority. 
 Edem as a  community of strong and influential people is located in part of Northern Nsukka. The community from creation is made up of hard working man and women. The community is gifted in the art of traditional medicine, rainmaking and farmwork. With the emergence of 

education and enterprise, the citizens of the community have gone into various fields of human endeavours and the younger generation have transfered the skills of their forefathers in the field of herbalism to different fields of scientific medicine and surgery.  In the same vein, hundreds of her teeming population are into the military and paramilitary force where they play leadership roles, in civil service where they are leading technocrats, business enterprise etc. Today,  the people have improved on their leadership responsibilities by engaging in politics at national and international levels. 

    </p>
    <h4>
        TRADITIONAL RULERSHIP IN EDEM 
    </h4>
    <p>
        The idea of Eze and traditional rulership in Edem was introduced in about the 17th century. That was when Agbana Eze was enthroned as Eze Edem. He was from 

Igoro Akpa Edem.  His enthronement was facilitated by his closeness to the palace of Attah of Igalla who was married to his sister. Attah noticed his good manners and groomed him to be the Eze of Edem. Attah of Igalla had strong influence on communities in Nsukka judicial province at that time.

Agbana the first Igwe of Edem is from Igoro Akpa Edem and the last to come from there. His reign was brief  because  he killed  his wife for  insisting  that he, Eze Agbana, should come out from his council meeting  to help her put down a pot of water she fetched from the stream. The Oha Edem gathered and dethroned the king. They later chose Dimanyi Oshogwu from Owerre Agbo to replace him as Eze Edem. 
Eze Dimanyi Oshogwu’s reign was 

shortlived, he broke his own rules as he was caught warming himself near a fireplace, a thing which he probably said no one should do. This Eze Edem from Owerre was also discovered to have made earth mound, where he warmed  himself  during meetings while his colleagues were exposed to harmattan cold. This was discovered during one of their meetings and he was overthrown and the kingship offered to Dimeje Ogoli who had the power of making rain to fall from Amenu Edem. He initially declined but when further pressured, he gave the condition that it will be for him and his children after him. His conditions were obliged.(1)
Dimeje Ogoli performed all the ceremonies required of him. He reigned well and was succeeded by his sons and relations one after the other.
The following is the order of succession of 

children and brothers  of Dimeje Ogoli who occupied the exalted stool of Eze Edem:

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1. Eze Dimeje Ogoli</li>
        <li>2. Eze Agiri Iyoke</li>
        <li>3. Eze Edem Ode</li>
        <li>4. Eze Mbakwu Ayori</li>
        <li>5. Eze Omude Dimeje</li>
        <li>6. Ezekan Ugbobe</li>
        <li>7. Eze Onah Idenyi</li>
        <li>8. Eze Ukwunne</li>
        <li>9. Eze Ugwuanyi Nwaechara</li>
        <li>10. Eze Ogan Ukwunne</li>
        <li>11. Eze Dimanyi Ize Ajima</li>
        <li>12. Eze Nwaugwu Ada Ize</li>
        <li>13. Eze Ayigbo Ugwuanyi</li>
        <li>14. Eze Ngwoke Eze and</li>
        <li>15. Eze Francis Asogwa(2)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Eze John Ngwoke Eze was believed to have lived from  1873 to 1948. The said Eze Ngwoke Eze is the grandfather of Engr 

Jude Onyenwe Eze, the traditional ruler of Ugwu na Agbo Edem, who is being coronted today.

    </p>
    <h4>
        IGWE ENGR. JUDE ONYENWE EZE AND EXPECTATIONS OF A GRANDSON KING
    </h4>

    <p>
        Dimeje Ogoli and his offsprings ruled Edem in succession as aforestated.
Eze Ngwoke Eze was the second to the last of his lineage that ruled Edem. As Eze Edem,  he brought charm and humanity into the Edem local administration. The wave of Christianity making the rounds in the whole of Igboland had strong influence on the leadership direction of Eze Ngwoke Eze
Apart from making promises of a new better life and salvation, the new religion brought social development including schools, hospitals and skill acquisition programmes. Eze Ngwoke was intrigued  

by these developments. He reportedly trekked on several occasions to Nsukka the base of the Christian missionaries to make a case about how the missionaries could send a teacher to Edem to educate the people and administer the new faith. The Nsukka District Priest Fr. Vincent Davey granted this request by sending  one Patrick OKafor from Umuna to Onuagu Amenu  on 29th September, 1929.
To ensure the survival of this project,  Eze Ngwoke housed, fed and  paid this teacher for six months. From his house, Patrick OKafor was attending to his missionary duties at Catholic Mission Onuagu, an area that soon metamorphosed into the legendry Onuegu  primary school. It is important to note that while waiting for Christian activities to  commence fully at the newly established mission, Igwe Ngwoke Eze allowed Christian activities to 

take place in his house. 
Igwes's house was used as the church till after six months when the Catholic mission at Onuegu started full operation and that was when the first mass was celebrated in the church on 4th October  1930 by Fr. Vincent Davey (3).
As the Eze Edem, Eze Ngwoke combined his traditional administration with Christian formation which ultimately resulted in the establishment of an egalitarian Edem society. The level of socialisation was upped, even as people began to make input into how their affairs will be administered.  Eze Ngwoke was driven by democratic ideals. 
Eze Ngwoke successfully created the Onuagu Mission which served as the worship center of the whole of Edem between 1929 to 1935. There was a growing concern to reduce the strain of 

people from lower Edem Ani ( the Agbo Edem  Ani). That was how the mission was transfered to Nweke Ogbete in Agbo Edem Ani in 1935 and named St. Paul's Catholic Church which to the glory of God is today,  a fully functioning Church with thousands of parishioners. 
The historic Catholic mission at Onuagu retained its spot as a divine centre and served as primary school and worship centre until 1977 when it was inaugurated as St Theresa's Catholic Church Ugwu na Agbo, attaining the status of a parish in 2013.
As Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze ascends the throne as traditional ruler of Ugwu na Agbo Community,  we wish him a peaceful reign and wisdom.
We wish him peaceful collaboration and brotherly love with other Igwes in Edem as they join hand to uphold the indivisible 

unity of Edem as  a  community.

His siblings are Victoria, Stella, Nwamaka, Okwudili, Lebechi, Nkechi, and Ifeanacho. Like all great men, HRH Engr Jude O Eze had his shaky start when in 1976, he underwent major surgery due to ruptured appendicitis at Akulue Memorial Hospital Onuiyi, Nsukka. This exercise nearly took a fatal turn due to series of complications. He emerged from this 

event with hard-boiled skin to navigate the onerous challenges of life that dot the nooks and crannies of existence.

In 1977, HRH Engr Jude Onyenwe Eze joined his sister and her husband, Mrs. Christiana Ozoemena and Engr John Ozoemena (both of blessed memory) at Abakaliki where he continued his primary education at Urbana Primary School Kpiri-Kpiri, Abakaliki. Thereafter, he got admission into the popular Premier Secondary School, Ukebe, later turned Special Science Secondary School, Ukehe, Igbo Em Local Government Area of Enugu State.

CAREER HRH Engr Jude O Eze as a Youth Corper in Abuja started a daily contribution business at Nyanya in Abuja. Being an astute manager of material and human resources, he was able to steer the activity into a fruitious business that blossomed in leaps and bounds. So successful was the initiative that in the words of his cousin, Barr C C Eze, "he developed a firm of rural banking where you can bank your money with him and equally collect loan if 

need be". Today, Engr Jude O.

Eze has expanded on the rural banking project by engaging seriously in the property business. HRH Engr Jude O Eze has established a formidable business empire that has over a thousand persons in his payroll TEMPERAMENT: Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze is a happy person who mixes freely with the mighty and the lowly. He loves associating with people of all ages. He feels the pains of others and hates injustice. He loves to see others happy and could go to a substantial length to ameliorate another's discomfort. He is a firm believer in hard work. Although he has effusive smiles as his trademark, his mien often displays a shrewd countenance that brings to the fore his inclination as a businessman. He is calm and calculative. SPECIAL INTERESTS: He loves children and plays with them. This special interest in the welfare and future of children has motivated 

him to moot the idea of building an orphanage Mother Theresa Orphanage at Ugwu na Agbo Edem. This project is in progress. AS A SPORTSMAN: Igwe Jude Onyenwe Eze is athletically built with well-fissured biceps muscles that can easily inform observant eyes that this man is in love with sports involving the muscles. He has deep interests in long tennis, table tennis, and boxing.

of academic work. Even as a business executive in Abuja, Igwe Obaneku Oshimiri still found time to engage in these past times which give him joy and consortium, especially table tennis. HIS LOVE FOR ARTWORK: Ironically, unlike the scientist that he is, Igwe has immense love for the work of art. He draws a lot of inspiration from collections of great artwork and graphics which he spends a fortune on. This artwork and colors are copiously displayed in his homestead and offices and feature images and colors that communicate joy, love, excitement, disappointment, hope, and even sober reflection. He has a great sense of dressing and color selection. PHILANTHROPY: Igwe is a philanthropist who in most cases prefer anonymity in what he does.

    <h4>A ROYAL DYNASTY <br>

       <span> *By Chief Jude C. Ezema (KSJI) </span>
    </h4>
    <p>
The first indigenous and ancient priesthood which traditionally combined clerical and political duties of leaders in the village-based republic. Ezes were recognized in Arochukwu, Awka, Nri, Owerre, and Northern Nsukka which includes Edem. 
Eze is an Igbo word which means King, Igbo people use such words as Igwe and Obi plus others as titles of respect and homage to the Eze, Igwe is derived from the Igbo word Igwekala or Eluigwekala “the sky or haven above the sky is higher or bigger than land”
In Igbo tradition and culture, the Eze is normally an absolute monarch advised by a council of chiefs or elders who he appoints based on their good standing within the community.
The Igbo people had and still have ruling bodies of royal and political leaders in which an individual can be recognized by the entire society as primus inter pares ie first among equals. This status is usually hereditary among the male lineage since Igbo culture is patrilineal.
In Edem which is part of Northern Nsukka, had her kingship established about the 17th century through Agbana from Akpa Edem who followed the sister who was married to the then Atta of Igala.
In Atta’s palace, the young boy was well behaved and good-mannered. Atta decided to compensate the young man by making him the Eze of Edem since Edem had not hither to have a king. The young man was groomed in all aspects of palace administration, Agbana was taken to Edem in a ceremony known to all Edem as their king.


Agbana the first Igwe of Edem is from Igoro and was the last as he killed his wife because of the wife’s insistence while he was having a council meeting that the Igwe must help her unload her pot of water, coming back from the local stream. The Oha Edem gathered and dethroned the king. They later chose Dimanyi Oshogwu from Owerre Agbo.
Eze Dimanyi Oshogwu’s reign was short-lived, he broke his own rules. The Eze Edem was barred from warming himself near a fire. The Eze Edem from Owerre was also discovered to have made earth mound, warming himself while his colleagues were exposed to harmattan cold. This was discovered during one of their meetings and he was overthrown and the kingship was offered to Dimeje Ogoli who had the power of making rain to fall. He initially declined but when further pressured, he gave the condition that it will be for him and his children after him.
Dimeje Ogoli performed all the ceremonies required of him. Dimeje reigned well and was succeeded by his sons and relations one after the other.
The last from his lineage, that performed the rights was John Ngwoke Eze who died in 1946 (he is the grandfather of HRH Engr Jude Onyenwe Eze who is today performing the ceremonies to ascend to his forefather's throne) 
To further give credence to this agreement, the following brothers and children of Dimeje Ogoli occupied the exalted stool of Eze Edem:
Eze Dimeje Ogoli
Eze Agiri Iyoke
Eze Edem Ode
Eze Mbakwu Ayori
Eze Omude Dimeje
Ezekan Ugbobe
Eze Onah Idenyi
Eze Ukwunne
Eze Ugwuanyi Nwaechara
Eze Ogan Okwume
Eze Dimanyi Ize Ajima
Eze Mbakwu Eze
Eze Nwaugwu Ada Ize
Eze Ayigbo Ugwuanyi
Eze Ngwoke Eze
Eze Francis Asogwa
Edem had two sons; Owa and Edem Ani, Owa being the first. According to tradition, Owa was expected to live with his father and inherit his property. However contrary to custom, Owa with his family left his father in search of a suitable site for his own settlement. He settled down there and called it Owa after his name.
Edem ani, the second village in Edem clan is made up of eleven sub-villages, Odojo, Isu, Umuchoke, Uwani, Amenu Ozara, Nkofi, Amogwu, Ubogidi, Umuchagwo and Owerre. Five of the sub-villages, namely; Odojo, Isu, Umuchoke, Uwani and Amenu claim to have descended from Edem ani; the second son of Edem. According to tradition, Edem ani had left his father, Edem to establish his settlement. After traveling for about 5 km, he came to an unoccupied area that apart from being suitable for farming, had a number of perennial streams. He settled down at the place with his wife and called it Edem ani after his name. He had five sons. These are in order of seniority were; Odojo, Isu, Oma Nworie, Uwani, and Ogori Awedo  with the exception of Odojo who lived with his father, the other four left their father in search of sites for the new settlement. Each of them found a sub-village, Isu the second son, founded Isu which he called after his name. The third son, Oma Nworie founded Umuchoke, while Uwani, the fourth son founded the sub-village bearing his name. The youngest, Ogori Awedo founded the Amenu sub-village.
When Edem ani died, his sons agreed that the place where their father first settled should be a sub-village called Odojo (after Edem ani’s first son) while the five sub-village groups of Odojo, Isu, Umuchoke, Uwani and Amenu should be called Edem ani after their father. 
Ozara, the sixth sub-village in Edem was founded by Ezenyiko Utazi, the second son of Owa, Edem-ani’s brother. According to tradition, Ezenyiko Utazi was a hunter and during one of his hunting activities, he discovered a forest area that was suitable for farming. He gave up hunting as a profession and settled down as a farmer at the site which is called Ozara meaning an area previously uninhabited by people.
The six Edem ani sub-villages discussed above namely, Odojo, Isu, Umuchoke, Uwani, Amenu and Ozara have a common origin. All of them descended from Edem, the founder of Edem clan. Consequently, they regard themselves as the nto n’ ani (the aborigines of Edem ani).
The remaining five sub-villages of Edem ani namely; Nkofi, Amogwu, Owerre, Ubogidi and Umuchiagwo are not the descendants of Edem. They were later immigrants to Edem ani. Although the order of their arrival is unknown, tradition maintain that he founder of Nkofi arrived before those of other sub-villages.
Ozi, the third village in Edem conssits of four sub-villages namely: Ama-ogu, Ezi Ozi, Umoko and Iyewuru. None of the sub-villages in Ozzi claims to have descended from Edem, the founding father of the clan. According to Ozi tradition, the founder of each of the four sub-villages migrated to Edem from other areas.
The founder of the Ama ogu sub-village, Dimanu was the first to settle at Ozi. He came from Ubogidi, one of the sub-villages in Edem ani. Dimanu left his brother Dianevu at Ubogidi and went away in search of food. He came to the place now called Ama Ogu.
The other three sub-villages; Umuoko, Ezi-ozi and Iyewuru had accepted and still accept the fact that Ama ogu settled first at Ozi because of this, Ama ogu was and still is the traditional head of Ozi.
The Eze title in Nsukka prior to independence is in most cases confined to a single family. The candidate may be anyone from this family who had sufficient means to take it. In Edem, the Eze title is confined to the Amenu family of Ugwu na Agbo kindred.
The Eze Edem was a symbol of peace and unity and he acted as the central figure in all the matters affecting them.
Ugwu na Agbo Community is blessed to have a worthwhile son of Amenu Edem as his first traditional ruler - HRH Engr Jude Onyenwe Eze (Oba n’eku Oshimiri.
Here comes a new era in our history and we must brace up to positively influence our future and history.

God bless us all.
